Not too big, not too small; the mid length is a great surfboard for surfers wanting to catch waves easily while still retaining a certain degree of maneuverability. Features of a mid length surfboard include the full nose, low-to-moderate rocker, boxy rails and mid-to-high volume. Often referred to as a "mini-mal", and popular for being very stable, mid length surfboards are typically 7 - 8 feet in length and really shine in small to medium size surf.
